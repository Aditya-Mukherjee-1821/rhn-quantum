# rhn_bqm
This repository contains a very basic implementation of an RHN network solved using Dwave's dimod library, using BQM formulation.

The code optimizes the cost of production based on per watt energy prices. I also ensures that the temperatures are well withing the specified ranges as well as the differential pressure between twin pipes are as close to zero.
